## 3.2. Introduction to the Architect's Mindset

There are some points of view, in addition to the technical one, that must be considered.

- It's necessary to learn about the inner part of the business.
  - Understand the business and the company as a total.
  - Weaknesses, strengths, competition, growth strategy.

## 3.4. Define the System's Goals

- Goals are not Requirements.
  - Not "What the system should do".

- Goals describe the system's effect on the organization.
  - What is the environment our system is going to be operating in.
  - What are the main tasks it's going to tackle.

- Usually described by the client, but there are exceptions.
  - Sometimes, after several discussions, the system's scope can be changed to focus on  the most effective functionality.

## 3.5. Work for Your Client's Clients

- Architect's clients == Client's clients
  - Sometimes the system's end users, but not always.
- Yous must consider the final client's impacts for each decision, balancing it with direct company impacts (like costs, development time, etc).
- Deal with the final client is a System Analyst's job, but the Architect must be closely involved to understand the "end goals".
- Your client might not view users as Clients.

- **Use**:

> Have you heard about the latest Angular version? We're going to use it!

### 3.6.3. Example 3: CEO
